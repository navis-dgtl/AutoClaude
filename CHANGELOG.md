   - Screenshots folder in Documents now properly created
   - Better path handling for nested directories
   - Supports patterns like "Documents/Screenshots" or "to Screenshots folder in Documents"
   - Automatically creates subdirectories with `recursive: true`

2. **Natural Language Parser Improvements**

   - Handles variations like:
     - "to Screenshots folder in Documents"
     - "to Documents/Screenshots"
     - "to a Screenshots folder"
   - Smart destination detection for common folders

3. **File Move Operation Enhanced**
   - Properly handles destination as directory vs filename
   - Creates intermediate directories as needed
   - Better error handling for cross-device moves

### üîß Technical Changes
1. **Configuration Updates**
   - Changed `allowed_directories` from string to directory type
   - Added `multiple: true` and `required: true` flags

2. **Server Updates**
   - Parse directories from command line arguments
   - Enhanced logging shows allowed directories
   - Better path expansion and validation

## Version 1.1.0 (Fixed Version)

### üö® Critical Fixes
1. **Implemented Natural Language Processing**
   - Added NaturalLanguageParser class that actually converts text to workflows
   - Supports scheduling patterns (daily, hourly, weekly, specific times)
   - Recognizes file operations (move, copy, delete, create, archive)
   - Identifies file types (screenshots, images, documents, downloads)
   - Generates appropriate workflow names and descriptions

2. **Cross-Platform File Operations**
   - Replaced Unix-specific commands (mv, cp, rm) with Node.js built-in functions
   - Uses fs.promises for all file operations
   - Handles cross-device moves properly
   - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

3. **Fixed Memory Leaks**
   - Added MAX_EXECUTION_HISTORY limit (1000 entries)
   - Automatic cleanup of old execution history
   - Proper cleanup of scheduled jobs and file watchers
   - Graceful shutdown handling

### üêõ Bug Fixes
1. **Configuration Parsing**
   - Added environment variable expansion for paths
   - Supports $HOME, ${HOME}, and ~ notation
   - Properly handles comma-separated directory lists

2. **Workflow Loading Race Condition**
   - Loads all workflows first, then sets up triggers
   - Prevents triggers from firing before workflows are ready

3. **Process Management**
   - Added proper cleanup on shutdown
   - Kills active processes on SIGINT/SIGTERM
   - Closes file watchers properly

4. **Path Security**
   - Enhanced path validation
   - Prevents path traversal attacks
   - Case-insensitive path checking

### ‚ú® New Features
1. **Execution Queue System**
   - Prevents concurrent execution conflicts
   - Configurable MAX_CONCURRENT_WORKFLOWS limit
   - Queues workflows for sequential execution

2. **Workflow Validation**
   - Validates all workflow fields before saving
   - Checks cron expressions
   - Validates step configurations

3. **Enhanced Tool: create_workflow_from_nlp**
   - Single-step workflow creation from natural language
   - Automatically generates triggers and steps
   - Provides detailed feedback on created workflows

4. **Update Workflow Tool**
   - Allows updating existing workflow steps and triggers
   - Handles enabled/disabled state properly

5. **Better Error Responses**
   - Consistent error handling across all tools
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Prevents duplicate operations

### üîß Code Quality Improvements
1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Separated natural language parsing into its own class
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Cleaner code organization

2. **Proper Async/Await Usage**
   - Fixed promise handling throughout
   - No more callback hell
   - Better error propagation

3. **Enhanced Logging**
   - More descriptive console output
   - Shows platform information
   - Better execution tracking

### üìã Known Limitations (Still TODO)
1. Archive functionality not implemented
2. Loop functionality not implemented  
3. Advanced condition evaluation not implemented
4. No webhook support yet
5. No plugin architecture yet

### üîê Security Enhancements
1. Directory access restrictions enforced
2. Command execution disabled by default
3. Path validation on all file operations
4. No shell injection vulnerabilities

### üìä Performance Improvements
1. Efficient file operations using streams
2. Automatic history cleanup
3. Resource usage limits
4. Proper memory management
